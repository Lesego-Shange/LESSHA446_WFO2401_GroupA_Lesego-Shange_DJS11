## Introduction

The Podcast App allows users to explore a variety of podcasts categorized by genres. Users can view details about each show, including its image, description, number of seasons, genres, and last updated date. The app supports filtering by genres and includes a "Load More" feature to dynamically load additional shows.

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Shows

Upon loading the app, you'll see a carousel featuring selected shows. Use the genre dropdown to filter shows by category. Scroll down to view a grid layout of shows, each displaying key details. Clicking on a show takes you to its detailed page.

### Load More

At the bottom of the show grid, a "Load More" button allows you to fetch additional shows dynamically.
